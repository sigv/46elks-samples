# 46elks samples: Playing audio in voice calls

An outgoing call can be initiated and set to only play a specific pre-recorded message to the remote party.

Using the following `voice_start` configuration allows doing just that with the 46elks API.

## voice_start

```json
{
  "play": "http://example.com/message.wav"
}
```
